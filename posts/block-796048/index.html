Although prior attempts at SEC approval have not succeeded, who else stands a better chance than the top player in the investment game&mldr; Right? Hot on BlackRock&rsquo;s heels, three additional companies - <a href=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1855781/000119312521278390/d233987ds1a.htm>Invesco</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1850391/000121465923008647/p620230s1a2.htm">WisdomTree</a>, and <a href=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713123007682/valkyrie-s1a_062123.htm>Valkyrie</a> - have thrown their hats in the ring, filing for their own Bitcoin ETFs. Interestingly, Invesco even ranks amongst the top ten global investment firms.</p><blockquote><p>The jury&rsquo;s still out on whether these developments are a boon or a bane. While a spot ETF has the potential to sway Bitcoin&rsquo;s price in any direction, its contribution to the network isn&rsquo;t crystal clear. After all, Bitcoin was born from the belief that individuals should be their own bankers, without leaning on intermediaries. In this light, the concept of an exchange-traded ETFdoes not align with Satoshi&rsquo;s original vision.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=-euro-banks-join-the-bitcoin-custody-race>🏦 Euro Banks Join the Bitcoin Custody Race

The allegation is that Binance could be muddling its own capital with customer funds and using them for reserve attestations. Doubts have also arisen over the backing of shitcoins minted on the Binance blockchain, such the BUSD, with potential issues of insufficient collateral and possible double pledging being raised.</p><blockquote><p>While the article stops short of explicitly accusing Binance of any fraudulent dealings, it underscores potential behaviors that might be ethically dubious. These matters could have a notable impact on bitcoin&rsquo;s performance, at least in the short-term. It&rsquo;s essential to bear in mind that issues with an exchange like Binance can affect bitcoin, as witnessed with MtGox and FTX. However, even if an exchange does collapse, the Bitcoin network continues undeterred, with the next block getting mined approximately every 10 minutes. Tick tock, next block.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=-the-silence-of-the-sec>🤐 The Silence of the SEC

Huizenga argues that all the SBF-related documents thus far handed over by the SEC were already in the public domain. This implies a lack of engagement by the commission in response to inquiries from Congress. Further, the commission has fallen short in adhering to the preset deadline for document submission, leading to &ldquo;serious questions about the SEC&rsquo;s process and its cooperation with the Department of Justice&rdquo; in relation to the SBF case. Other legislators have also raised concerns over the SEC&rsquo;s oversight in the FTX context. As it stands, Bankman-Fried is grappling with two criminal cases, while civil suits have been put on hold.</p><blockquote><p>All eyes are now on Gary as we anticipate his response to these delays. Given the known connections between him and SBF, and his conspicuous silence throughout the exchange scam, the unraveling of this complicated tale is indeed riveting.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=-hong-kongs-latest-bitcoin-fortune-cookie>🥢 Hong Kong&rsquo;s Latest Bitcoin Fortune Cookie
