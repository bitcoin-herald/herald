On the night of 14th of June 2011 Wikileaks turned to bitcoin as a lifeline for receiving donations. This was a strategic move to counteract a politically motivated banking blockade crafted by leading banks and payment service providers under the influence of the U.S. The attack has destroyed 95% of the organization's revenue, and if it wasn't for Bitcoin, Wikileaks might have ceased to exist. Free speech is inseparable from censorship-resistant money. Remember that!

üí© A Ton of Shitcoin News From Binance
--------------------------------------

Binance has provided lots of news to discuss this week -- from potential Lightning adoption growth to regulatory troubles of the biggest shitcoin casino.

![img](https://nostr.build/i/51db56be4b08c734615c09349133c4380fd65564af9d5e87118ab489e054ce14.gif)¬†

In the past week, a ruling in favor of Binance allowed the exchange to maintain control over customer assets. Despite this, it's no clear win, as negotiations with the SEC are still ongoing. Currently, an understanding [has been reached](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/17/binance-sec-strike-deal-to-move-all-us-customer-funds-wallet-keys-back-onshore/) between the SEC and Binance that restricts Binance's international platform employees from accessing BinanceUS assets.

On another note, Binance [has introduced](https://pool.binance.com/en/acceleration?ref=AZTKZ9XS&utm_source=BinanceTwitter&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) a new transaction accelerator. This feature allows users to push a bitcoin transaction into the subsequent block -- quite a handy tool during times of high user activity and elevated fees. However, there's a catch -- only Binance VIP users can access this feature. Specifically, users must have a monthly trading volume exceeding $1M on the spot market or $15M on futures.

> It's perplexing to see a feature that would benefit beginners, being exclusively available to experienced traders with large volumes. But, there's a bright side: the more the exchange neglects the average user, the more these users are inclined to discover Bitcoin's features, such as Replace-by-Fee (RBF). For a detailed understanding of RBF, you can refer to [this extensive guide](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/rbf-replace-by-fee/) by Bitcoin Manual.

Arguably, the most interesting move by Binance was the long overdue [opening](https://amboss.space/node/03a1f3afd646d77bdaf545cceaf079bab6057eae52c6319b63b5803d0989d6a72f) of lightning channels. Although there's been no official statement on Lightning support, this move certainly hints at future plans. Channels of 10 and 5 BTC have been opened with Kraken and OKX, respectively, indicating the probable future introduction of deposit/withdrawal functionalities via the Lightning network.

{{< nostr note1a3cmfxk8hnhr8t047vx8m2gcjw4jlwjyn6lv78t3vqsdv2mld77sj4n28e >}}

> While Binance appears to position itself as a friendly guide, its focus on profit generation can't be overlooked. Expect high fees to possibly accompany Lightning withdrawals.

Internationally, Binance's situation isn't rosy. News broke this week about Binance [exiting](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-on-changes-of-services-in-the-netherlands-b5a647be31cf469b87fc3337fd461ced) the Dutch market, while in France, investigations into the exchange are [ongoing](https://newsinfrance.com/binance-the-worlds-leading-cryptocurrency-exchange-under-investigation-in-france/).

‚õèÔ∏è Bitmain Reigns Supreme?¬†
---------------------------

A recent study evaluating the mining sector shows Bitmain as the clear frontrunner.

![img](https://nostr.build/i/c7e08e3e00d717c6c69341ba7873b82664149157ef5d6aa7cfe0da7569d764a9.jpg)¬†

Karim Helmi, a researcher at Coinmetrics, has conducted a study revealing that the mining rig market isn't as decentralized as it seems. In fact, three models from Bitmain - the s19, s19jpro, and s19xp - have a stronghold on the market, accounting for a whopping 76%. Consequently, these models are responsible for the majority of the hash rate generation.

{{< nostr note1a3269jy5gnpzx0x3dda86xr84vyezq8hzmgg73slwkq066p59pkq8ns7qs >}}¬†

> More competition in the market would be beneficial, and we're keenly observing as [Blockstream](nostr:npub1jg552aulj07skd6e7y2hu0vl5g8nl5jvfw8jhn6jpjk0vjd0waksvl6n8n) ventures into this space with their mining devices. We're looking forward to seeing how the market landscape might change in a few years, Karim.

üî´ Attack on Educational Bitcoin Channels
-----------------------------------------

Swan Bitcoin YouTube channel got blocked.

![img](https://nostr.build/i/af5aa31ad5370912f9ea0db342b80c536ee2587df2771caa811e54d5c7dce92d.jpg)¬†

The Swan Bitcoin YouTube channel [was removed](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1668661102924935169) by the platform this week. Interestingly, YouTube opted to proceed with this action without giving any particular reason.¬†

YouTube's explanation for the ban:

> "We reviewed your channel carefully, and have confirmed that it violates our Community Guidelines. We know this is probably disappointing news, but it's our job to make sure the YouTube is a safe place for all. We won't be putting your channel back up on Youtube."

Though the channel has now been reactivated, the incident raises serious questions about YouTube's practices. Swan has decided to transfer their educational content about Bitcoin and macroeconomics to their new media outlet on [https://Twitter.com/swan](https://twitter.com/swan).

> While Swan's move is based on valid reasons, it doesn't represent an ideal solution. Twitter, similar to YouTube, has its own track record of censorship incidents, thus it's not a dependable platform. We are hopeful and confident that Nostr will offer the tools required for educational initiatives to share their content in a decentralized, censorship-resistant manner. Currently, Nostr's lightweight relays, which contribute to the protocol's resilience, cannot host videos, but we are certain that some way will be found. There's no question about it.

üìà BlackRock's Bitcoin Ballgame
-------------------------------

The leading asset manager has filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF.

![img](https://nostr.build/i/2a061d82665c3befa239f404b0025ce4b9bc696555f419eb25b54cf164eab296.jpg) 

BlackRock, the world's leading asset manager, [has filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm) for a spot Bitcoin ETF, with Coinbase Custody as their chosen custodian. The proposed ETF will be pegged against indices from CF Benchmarks, drawing data from six exchanges. Despite the SEC's history of rejecting spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock's application could potentially pave the way for wider Bitcoin adoption and create a new, regulated investment pathway.

üçè Apple Sounds the War Drums
-----------------------------

This week, Apple threw down the gauntlet to three Lightning payment apps, challenging their existence on the App Store. The tech giant has demanded that these app developers remove the functionality, or face expulsion from the App Store.

{{< nostr note1e8r4ft7vwhe9067w2xktrdve87k7wc3ydw66mp7m7u7wj6jxdx4s3mrk2m >}}

Will Casarin, the developer behind Damus, was the first to be issued such a letter:

{{< nostr note14vfvfnt8ynlp4qj2fcdt5t28judjypdnth83swmdhlythryw2seq2nuuh6 >}}

Subsequently, Zeus was informed that their updated app version would not be allowed on the App Store unless they complied with Apple's guidelines.

{{< nostr note1cvf2xae8p5pvkxkwhdnayxqaun7a7ryk29exfc745d5hty4qft7qzln778 >}}

Fold became the third app within a 48-hour timeframe to receive Apple's written directive:  

{{< tweet user="wlrvs" id="1669396648148213761" >}}

> It's clear that applications facilitating free financial transactions cannot satisfy the corporate giants' demand for absolute control and extraction of revenue from developers, creators, and users. The most viable solution appears to be Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). These applications, in their optimal form, could offer users a similar experience, including offline functionality, swift browsing, and notifications, without the need for developers to pay hefty fees to profit-hungry corporations and bureaucratic entities. [Tony](nostr:npub10awzknjg5r5lajnr53438ndcyjylgqsrnrtq5grs495v42qc6awsj45ys7) delves into the basics of PWA in his Habla blog post: nostr: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

‚ö°Ô∏è 1 Million Zaps
-----------------

*The recent zapathon has set a new record, playing host to the one-millionth zap on Nostr.*

{{< nostr note1safx5k0fj4xcma9azzkm7ma7zzzu34e32n5pk0rqvms4c5chvurslqtwsy >}}

This remarkable milestone comes at an intriguing time, coinciding with Apple's intensified scrutiny of Damus, Nostr's leading iOS app. Whether this surge is fueled by users' defiance or the natural expansion of the user base and zap popularity, one fact stands clear: Nostr is unstoppable.

Wallet of Satoshi also reported the outcome of the latest zapathon, marking it an extraordinary event:

{{< nostr note1ze9h86u4fzf76he5gfev8gre5x72a4glhept4x6gwws40pk5gc0sxtdgnp >}}

> While it appears that this zapathon may be the final one for Damus users (for the time being), we advise not to hastily predict Damus's demise. Will, Damus's developer, has teased some intriguing plans for navigating Apple's idiotic demands and maintaining the zap functionality on the App Store.
