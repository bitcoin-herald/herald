You might think it&rsquo;s the dubious shitcoins to blame, but think again - even BTC wasn&rsquo;t safe. As for the mystery &lsquo;who&rsquo;, &lsquo;how&rsquo; and &lsquo;why&rsquo; of the hack, everyone&rsquo;s got a theory. Some say it&rsquo;s the handiwork of a supply chain attack where the app stores&rsquo; software got a nasty makeover. Others are pointing fingers at the wallet&rsquo;s antique transaction signing dependencies that basically rolled out a welcome mat for hackers to guess the seed phrases.</p><p>Just to add some spice, the security watchdogs over at Least Authority had raised a red flag last year about Atomic Wallet&rsquo;s flimsy security set up, suggesting it was an easy target for cyber crooks. They even gave some friendly advice: tidy up your code and up your game.

Well, it&rsquo;s kinda like the birthplace of many Bitcoin firsts. First mining pool, first hardware wallet, first Bitcoin conference, and even the first Bitcoin café. Yup, all brewed right here in Prague. It&rsquo;s fair to say this city is a Bitcoin hotspot on the European map, and strolling its cobblestone streets was a real hoot!</p><p>The shindig took place on the city outskirts, a breeze to reach. Picture this: three massive venues decked out to the nines. One rocking the main stage, another showcasing an expo of Bitcoin&rsquo;s brightest and boldest and hosting a secondary stage. The third? It&rsquo;s a chill-out area connecting the first two, with benches perfect for kicking back, grabbing a bite, and washing it down with a frothy Czech brew.</p><blockquote><p>Keep your eyes peeled for a detailed write-up on our conference capers and juicy takeaways.</p></blockquote><p>Despite the lineup of top-notch speakers gracing the main stage, the sound quality was a bummer. If you were hoping for some ground-breaking reveals (we&rsquo;re looking at you, Michael Saylor), watching the replay on YouTube won&rsquo;t rob you of anything. But hey, the company expo and the secondary stage were a riot! Speakers doled out some game-changing ideas, and the hands-on demos of Bitcoin innovations were eye-openers. Plus, the chance to hobnob with fellow Bitcoin enthusiasts was the cherry on top!</p><blockquote><p>A massive shout-out to the Trezor team, who played the perfect hosts. They got us up to speed with the conference vibe in no time, and we even scored a new Trezor hardware wallet to bring home! Who knew that such a big-name company could be filled with such friendly folks? And it wasn&rsquo;t just us - they spread the love to all attendees.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So, are you marking your calendar for next year&rsquo;s BTCPrague? You bet!

Their crime? An alleged plot to scrub clean the funds swiped from Japanese exchange Mt.Gox - we&rsquo;re talking about a whopping 647,000 bitcoins!</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that back in 2011, our two accused masterminds wormed their way into Mt.Gox&rsquo;s servers. And where were they headed? Straight to the mother lode - the private keys of the exchange&rsquo;s unsuspecting customers. Their grand scheme was to siphon off the funds into wallets they controlled and then perform a high-stakes laundromat operation.</p><blockquote><p>So, does this latest development shuffle the Mt.Gox deck? Not likely, folks. The wheels of the bankruptcy proceedings have been grinding on for years, and the charges served didn&rsquo;t whisper a word about seizing or confiscating anything. Looks like this might just be the final curtain call for the notorious exchange&rsquo;s drama, but for the poor folks who lost their stash, the story continues.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=-tether-will-mine-on-a-volcano>🌋 Tether will Mine on a Volcano

<a href=#-new-vulnerability-class-in-ecdsa-signatures class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p><em>A new vulnerability class has been discovered in ECDSA signatures, allowing access to wallets.</em></p><p><img src=https://nostr.build/i/393b5e9af8fb9f9f817a47f17289f4905683c49cc19e97938e88860b080d0a11.png alt=img> </p><p>Researchers from the California Institute in San Diego <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/841.pdf>have spotlighted</a> a new class of vulnerability lurking within ECDSA signatures on the Bitcoin blockchain. This flaw emerges when a nonce is created by melding together half the bits from the message hash and half from the secret signing key. A simple countermeasure exists though: deterministic ECDSA nonce generation as outlined in RFC 6979. This safeguard is already implemented in the core library for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>According to the authors, this weakness could potentially lay bare not only private keys but also disrupt the integrity of Bitcoin pseudonyms and addresses in user implementations of ECDSA. That said, exploiting this flaw requires deliberately exposing the target to vulnerable software.</p><blockquote><p>We hypothesize that these signatures are an artifact of a custom ECDSA implementation used by a thief to steal these funds. A number of Bitcoin forum postings link addresses receiving these funds to a particular individual who is relatively public about these activities, in addition to other scams.</p></blockquote><h2 id=worth-mentioning>Worth mentioning:
