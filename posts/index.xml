On the night of 14th of June 2011 Wikileaks turned to bitcoin as a lifeline for receiving donations. This was a strategic move to counteract a politically motivated banking blockade crafted by leading banks and payment service providers under the influence of the U.S. The attack has destroyed 95% of the organization's revenue, and if it wasn't for Bitcoin, Wikileaks might have ceased to exist. Free speech is inseparable from censorship-resistant money. Remember that!</description></item><item><title>Block #794057</title><link>https://bitcoin-herald.org/posts/block-794057/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitcoin-herald.org/posts/block-794057/</guid><description>

Twelve years ago this week, the exchange rate of Bitcoin [reached](https://bitcal.21ideas.org/about/) $10 for the very first time. Of course, Bitcoin took a nosedive afterward, convincing many that it was all over. People were panic-selling their magical internet money, and blaming Bitcoin for every possible sin.
