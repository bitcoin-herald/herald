Hello, bitcoiner!
Today, 13 years ago, the first purchase of a physical product for bitcoin was made - Laszlo Heiniz exchanged 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas. And while many today are perplexed as to how it was possible to spend such an incredible amount of bitcoins for lunch, the more interesting question is: how was it possible to part with two perfectly good pizzas in exchange for some magical internet money?</description></item><item><title>Block #791985</title><link>https://bitcoin-herald.org/posts/block-792990/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitcoin-herald.org/posts/block-792990/</guid><description>

Hey, bitcoiner!
Twelve years ago this week, the exchange rate of Bitcoin reached $10 for the very first time. Of course, Bitcoin took a nosedive afterward, convincing many that it was all over. People were panic-selling their magical internet money, and blaming Bitcoin for every possible sin. The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s changed after twelve years is the rate of bitcoin against dirty fiat; people are still buying bitcoin in an attempt to get rich quick, and if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t live up to their expectations of instant exponential growth, they complain about anything and everything, except their own greed.</description></item></channel></rss>
