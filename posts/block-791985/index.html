<a href=#the-biggest-bitcoin-holiday class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p><em>On 22 May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz purchased 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC, thus becoming the first person in history to pay for a good with bitcoin.</em></p><p><img src=https://www.21ideas.org/content/images/2023/05/data-src-image-8c3b8b6d-5f5c-48d3-823b-06f8dfc60ab5.png alt=2></p><p>Back on May 22, 2010, an incredible milestone in Bitcoin history occurred. Laszlo Hanyecz, a visionary programmer, made a groundbreaking move by purchasing two pizzas for a remarkable price of 10,000 BTC. It was the first-ever documented transaction where Bitcoin was used to buy a tangible item.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s rewind to May 18 of that year when Laszlo Hajnic, an enthusiastic participant on the bitcointalk forum, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1141#msg1141">was in search</a> of a way to exchange his bitcoins for something of value. He generously offered 10,000 BTC to anyone willing to have two delicious large pizzas delivered to his doorstep.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. [&mldr;] You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I&rsquo;m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don&rsquo;t have to order or prepare it myself.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Remarkably, within just four days, Laszlo&rsquo;s wish was fulfilled, and he enjoyed two piping hot pizzas for around $50 worth of the &ldquo;magic internet money.&rdquo; This memorable event marked the birth of a significant Bitcoin tradition, now known as the biggest Bitcoin holiday.</p><p>Each year on May 22, people from all corners of the globe join in this festive celebration by ordering or cooking pizzas, honoring Laszlo&rsquo;s pioneering spirit. This year was no exception, with various exciting activities taking place. For instance, Binance distributed pizzas to commemorate the occasion, and a Romanian blogger went above and beyond by ordering a staggering 10,000 pizzas for just over 1 BTC.</p><blockquote><p>The Bitcoin Herald team wishes to extend congratulations to everyone on this special holiday. While HODLing remains a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin culture, it is equally important to treat yourself with a delicious pizza and pay tribute to Laszlo, who played a pivotal role in driving Bitcoin adoption</p></blockquote><h2 id=trezor-hacked-again>🧑‍💻Trezor hacked again?

It&rsquo;s worth noting that hacking a wallet requires specialized equipment and physical access, making such incidents rare. Unciphered affirms that this vulnerability cannot be addressed with a simple patch.</p><p>While this news has garnered attention, it&rsquo;s not the first case of its kind. Approximately a year ago, a blogger <a href="https://youtu.be/dT9y-KQbqi4?ref=21ideas.org">managed to hack</a> a Trezor wallet, also requiring costly equipment and extensive expertise.</p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s important to emphasize that this occurrence is unlikely to impact Trezor&rsquo;s reputation or sales significantly. Hardware wallets are designed to safeguard users against online attacks, and by securely storing your seed and wallet, the risk of physical hacking can be mitigated.

Furthermore, silencing all relays except the meme (so far only works well on Damus) will give you a separate feed exclusively with selected memes.</p><p><img src=https://nostr.build/p/nb9411.gif alt=2></p><p>For more on what curated feeds are, how to subscribe to them and how to start your own, see my Habla post <a href=https://lnshort.it/feeds/>here</a> </p><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s still a long way to go in terms of improving the user experience, but Nostr is on the right track - the protocol aims to provide tools for end users to choose the information they consume, rather than entrust these decisions to a bunch of multibillion-dollar company directors. This is the way.</p></blockquote><h2 id=-zap-button-for-your-website>⚡️ Zap button for your website
