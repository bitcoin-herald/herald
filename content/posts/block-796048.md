📈 Bitcoin: The New Banksters' Darling
--------------------------------------

_There's an ever-growing list of companies jumping on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon._

![img](https://nostr.build/i/954188abb0d844f93eca7a1c925a571a398993c8bce25b86db32751b2f6f1b8b.jpg)

Last week, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, [led the charge](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm?ref=21ideas.org) by filing an application with the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Although prior attempts at SEC approval have not succeeded, who else stands a better chance than the top player in the investment game... Right? Hot on BlackRock's heels, three additional companies - [Invesco](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1855781/000119312521278390/d233987ds1a.htm), [WisdomTree](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1850391/000121465923008647/p620230s1a2.htm), and [Valkyrie](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713123007682/valkyrie-s1a_062123.htm) - have thrown their hats in the ring, filing for their own Bitcoin ETFs. Interestingly, Invesco even ranks amongst the top ten global investment firms.

> The jury's still out on whether these developments are a boon or a bane. While a spot ETF has the potential to sway Bitcoin's price in any direction, its contribution to the network isn't crystal clear. After all, Bitcoin was born from the belief that individuals should be their own bankers, without leaning on intermediaries. In this light, the concept of an exchange-traded ETFdoes not align with Satoshi's original vision.

🏦 Euro Banks Join the Bitcoin Custody Race
-------------------------------------------

_It's becoming hard to ignore the trend of banks stepping into the Bitcoin realm._

![img](https://nostr.build/i/3aa7621e71d3bbf826cbae0ab620265c917f56ca3d6dadae58e8a4e2a4ba6a5d.jpg) 

This week, the spotlight was on CACEIS, a French bank with a hefty $5.1 trillion under management, as they [registered](https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation#List_of_DASPs_registered_with_the_AMF) to become a Bitcoin custodian. But they're not alone. Germany's Deutsche Bank has also [lodged an application](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-20/deutsche-bank-applies-for-digital-asset-license-amid-growth-push?leadSource=uverify%20wall#xj4y7vzkg) with the local regulator to offer custodial services, a move that they had hinted at as far back as February 2021.

> It's undeniable that the world of traditional finance is making headway into the Bitcoin arena. Whether this signals a rise in adoption or simply means a tightening grip on everyday citizens, only time will tell. In the meantime, we suggest you keep your savings secure in non-custodial wallets - cold wallets if possible - and manage them yourself.

🔍 Don't trust Binance
----------------------

_Bitcoin Magazine has released a report warning its readers against using the Binance exchange_

![img](https://nostr.build/i/d8004f4034bb0f35f8cb95c9216fa005d9c971bfc6dab5ad028fb95293b07041.jpg>

The report [brings to light](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1672585193738194944?t=D_JR9qHARVg7FvCXsE2Opw&s=19) concerns about Binance, the leading shitcoin exchange, and its potential murky accounting practices. The allegation is that Binance could be muddling its own capital with customer funds and using them for reserve attestations. Doubts have also arisen over the backing of shitcoins minted on the Binance blockchain, such the BUSD, with potential issues of insufficient collateral and possible double pledging being raised.

> While the article stops short of explicitly accusing Binance of any fraudulent dealings, it underscores potential behaviors that might be ethically dubious. These matters could have a notable impact on bitcoin's performance, at least in the short-term. It's essential to bear in mind that issues with an exchange like Binance can affect bitcoin, as witnessed with MtGox and FTX. However, even if an exchange does collapse, the Bitcoin network continues undeterred, with the next block getting mined approximately every 10 minutes. Tick tock, next block.

🤐 The Silence of the SEC
-------------------------

_The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is being called out for delaying the release of documents related to the charges and arrest of ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried._

![img](https://nostr.build/i/d2535ddf1532d36b4fd3716d776c9da3843a91e1d0fd24d3da2892e605b1ed20.jpg)

Congressman Bill Huizenga, a Republican representative from Michigan, [has voiced](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408876) criticism against the SEC for not providing the necessary paperwork linked to the allegations and detention of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, widely known as SBF. Huizenga argues that all the SBF-related documents thus far handed over by the SEC were already in the public domain. This implies a lack of engagement by the commission in response to inquiries from Congress. Further, the commission has fallen short in adhering to the preset deadline for document submission, leading to "serious questions about the SEC's process and its cooperation with the Department of Justice" in relation to the SBF case. Other legislators have also raised concerns over the SEC's oversight in the FTX context. As it stands, Bankman-Fried is grappling with two criminal cases, while civil suits have been put on hold.

> All eyes are now on Gary as we anticipate his response to these delays. Given the known connections between him and SBF, and his conspicuous silence throughout the exchange scam, the unraveling of this complicated tale is indeed riveting.

🥢 Hong Kong's Latest Bitcoin Fortune Cookie
--------------------------------------------

_HSBC Expands shitcoin services, while spot bitcoin ETF awaits introduction._

HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, [has introduced](https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1673263927780859904) its new services. However, instead of offering direct Bitcoin or Ether ETF trading, they are providing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on futures contracts. It tracks the dynamics of futures exchange-traded funds traded on CME. The available options include CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF. While this move aims to expand Bitcoin and Ethereum exposure for local users, we're still eagerly waiting for a spot Bitcoin ETF to be introduced in Hong Kong. HSBC has also launched a Virtual Asset Investor Education Center to educate and protect investors from "crypto-related risks".. The center can be accessed through HSBC's virtual asset-related products and platforms.

This is not the first time we have seen "paper bitcoin ETFs". Such products are pretty popular on the US market. But this is the very beginning for Hong Kong, and we sincerely hope that soon, Hong Kong citizens will be able to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs on a par with standard bitcoins.

Could somebody please tell them that instead of making their customers aware of crypto risks, they could have explained everything with one sentence: "there are two things on the market, Bitcoin and scam".

Hong Kong's leading bank, HSBC, has unveiled its new offerings. However, instead of facilitating spot Bitcoin ETF trading, they're launching ETFs based on futures contracts. These mirror the progress of futures exchange-traded funds listed on CME. The available choices include the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF. While this initiative seeks to increase Bitcoin and Ethereum💩 access for local users, we're still keenly awaiting the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong. HSBC has also established a Virtual Asset Investor Education Center 🤡 to impart knowledge and shield investors from potential "crypto-related risks". The center can be accessed via HSBC's virtual asset-centric products and platforms.

> Perhaps HSBC could have simplified their warning about crypto risks to their customers with just one phrase: "There's bitcoin and there's scam".

✊ Freedom to Redditors
----------------------

Reddit's recent pivot to paid APIs has sparked a heated debate and stirred its user base, leading us to ponder: Could Nostr be the sanctuary disgruntled redditors seek?

![img](https://nostr.build/i/26a36280980857685aa267e96f7ee4416749f7f8eacf57088510125995c1a005.jpg)

In April, Reddit [announced](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/2023apiupdates?ref=21ideas.org) a significant change - the launch of paid APIs, a move that could drive third-party app developers into a corner. To illustrate, Apollo, the most popular Reddit-based app, [would be facing](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/?ref=21ideas.org) an enormous $20M yearly bill to maintain its operations at the current level.

The unsettling revelation has brightly illuminated the risks associated with reliance on centralized platforms. Scores of subreddits, housing tens of millions of users, retaliated by going private in protest. Despite this massive uproar, Reddit's top brass remained unmoved.

![img](https://nostr.build/i/0ee80e9cc2901bc504c2ec5bf23fda847df22cb8f023a8fbf0c7af0d20672d06.gif) 

Scrambling for alternatives, subreddit moderators turned to various solutions, including Mastodon, a familiar platform albeit with its own censorship woes, and ActivityPub-compatible platforms.

Shitcoiners rushed to invent blockchain-based social media and even offered half a million dollars to those who offer them a working solution...

{{< tweet user="desoprotocol" id="1669731130176831490" >}}

If simple API requests are too expensive, how exorbitant would it be to record each interaction on a truly  decentralized blockchain?

Why is Bitcoin Herald paying so much attention to Reddit's deadlock? It's simple: This issue isn't exclusive to Reddit, it pervades all social media and online communication in general. Nostr appears to be a viable solution. Sure, it's young, raw, and could be more developer-friendly. However, it shows immense promise. While other alternatives like Blue Sky are centralized and Mastodon is fragmented, [a dedicated Nostr client](https://nostr.kiwi/) with Reddit-like functionalities is already being actively developed:.

{{< nostr note187lwmnmr2kz424ygl8nn2cmutls2053z9tpj9akg39pmhfxjna4sq0kxdy >}}

On top of that some nostriches have embraced the new development by Jingles and we've now got a 150k sats bounty for developing an icon for the app.

{{< nostr note1u9eazf0q9kzrt3nsj7cqa3w5554ycx0u4f2255rswkq0nxlamxrqqqsxfh >}}

(the contest has been extended for one more day)

Further bolstering its credibility, general-purpose Nostr clients like [Satellite](https://satellite.earth/) have begun implementing moderation community functionality, and Amethyst has plans to follow suit.

{{< nostr note10pqugzks5l5zc4k3klzqn57duny4xm6gv628jeg8jy7axa0raymqeuzmlh >}}

Adding to its growing appeal, Nostr has already proved its mettle as a Twitter alternative, outdoing the social media giant in terms of user monetization. Last week, the one millionth zap was sent on Nostr.

{{< nostr note1safx5k0fj4xcma9azzkm7ma7zzzu34e32n5pk0rqvms4c5chvurslqtwsy >}}


> We believe that the future belongs to communications and monetary censorship-resistant protocols. It's why we, at Bitcoin Herald, focus on these crucial topics, not fleeting 'get-rich-quick' schemes. Join us in learning about Bitcoin and Nostr as the fight for freedom continues.

🐦 Twitter Exodus
-----------------

The stringent policies and escalating censorship under Twitter's new CEO are pushing users towards alternatives like Nostr.

![img](https://nostr.build/i/2e5582710fc95c9c4d279829f980f6e2eac7b31ea9b9d4393fdee273a9a53c55.jpg) 

Twitter's recent trajectory has seen its user numbers dwindle. Shadow bans and the introduction of a $8 monthly fee for more visible tweets have left users feeling frustrated. In response, many are exploring different social media platforms. The [Dewey Square Group](https://www.deweysquare.com/)'s report [shines a light](https://www.deweysquare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DSG-Snapshot-of-the-Twitter-Migration-June-2023.pdf) on this shift, revealing a surge in the popularity of censorship-resistant protocols.

> For the first time, Nostr has been featured in the report. Although still in its infancy compared to platforms like Mastodon, it's enjoying an [impressive growth](https://stats.nostr.band/?ref=21ideas.org) in user engagement.

⚡️ Zaps are Fighting for Survival
---------------------------------

Damus app developer is trying to find a workaround to fight Apple's hegemony.

![img](https://media.tenor.com/FVy76Pi9t4UAAAAC/thor-power.gif) 

Last week we reported on Apple's attacks on the apps suppporting Lightning Network. This week, Will Kasarin, developer of the most popular nostr client for iOS, Damus, released an updated Test Flight version of the app. The new version masterfully circumvents the technogiant's nonsensical requirements while still leaving the ability to send zaps within the app.

{{< nostr note1kyeg7d6yjeccuk3fjhjxzhujsrq0yr4jsvhszx5n6egpukmzqzvsppjefk >}}

The idea was to redirect the zappers from the note they want to support to the user profile page and make it look like the content creator, rather the note is being zapped. Unfortunately, Will reported today that this approach was rejected by Apple.

{{< nostr note1fy8e5apjw5vufcrxsywjgmthgs6de93tprnuwf6p4pm8e20pv92qhr4jyf >}}

> Regardless, these solutions are merely fleeting. As Will [highlighted](https://snort.social/e/note14mdey23fcf40zpjc5m970hucsazv5um63czm97kw23252qnpse4s37enad), the App Store's guidelines are crafted in such a way that allows the tech giant to discard any app supporting bitcoin payments without fretting about repercussions. 

{{< nostr note14mdey23fcf40zpjc5m970hucsazv5um63czm97kw23252qnpse4s37enad >}}

> As disheartening as it may seem, this is actually good for Nostr. The community is conscious of the issue, and it's not too late to address it. We're not wholly plunged into an Orwellian dystopia yet, making it an opportune moment to delve into censorship-resistant protocols and seek out or develop solutions to the mounting challenges related to the attacks on free speech.
