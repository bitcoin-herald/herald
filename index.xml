Hello, bitcoiner!
Today, 13 years ago, the first purchase of a physical product for bitcoin was made - Laszlo Heiniz exchanged 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas. And while many today are perplexed as to how it was possible to spend such an incredible amount of bitcoins for lunch, the more interesting question is: how was it possible to part with two perfectly good pizzas in exchange for some magical internet money?</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://bitcoin21ideas.github.io/herald/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitcoin21ideas.github.io/herald/about/</guid><description>

We&amp;rsquo;re majorly geeked up about Nostr, so the primo way to touch base with us is through a Nostr DM. But, for the old school among you, we&amp;rsquo;ve got email and some mainstream social media accounts, too. Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get it twisted. We&amp;rsquo;re not turning our backs on our fellow freedom fighters battling centralization and censorship. Nah, we&amp;rsquo;re just using those as bait to lure the normies into our purply, Bitcoin-enlightened world.</description></item><item><title>Support</title><link>https://bitcoin21ideas.github.io/herald/support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bitcoin21ideas.github.io/herald/support/</guid><description>
