Hey, bitcoiner!
On 9th of June 2021 El Salvador blazed the trail, making Bitcoin legal tender. While several nations intended to emulate this groundbreaking move, many faltered, ensnared by the allure of shitcoins or CBDCs.

Hey, bitcoiner!
Twelve years ago this week, the exchange rate of Bitcoin reached $10 for the very first time. Of course, Bitcoin took a nosedive afterward, convincing many that it was all over.

Hello, bitcoiner!
Today, 13 years ago, the first purchase of a physical product for bitcoin was made - Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas.
